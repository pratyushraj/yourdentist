export const PLAN_FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'What happens if I exceed my monthly consultation hours?',
    answer: 'If you are on the Essential or Growth plan and require additional advisory time, your dedicated advisor will notify you. You can either upgrade your plan immediately or purchase additional hours at a pre-agreed discounted rate. We ensure you are never surprised by extra charges.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the cancellation policy?',
    answer: 'All subscriptions are billed monthly or annually and are non-refundable. You may cancel your subscription at any time through your client portal settings. Cancellation will prevent future billing, but you will retain full access to the service until the end of the current paid billing period. Please refer to the full Refund Policy for exceptions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the billing cycle work?',
    answer: 'Billing is processed automatically via Razorpay on a recurring monthly or annual basis, starting from your sign-up date. You will receive an invoice 7 days before the charge is processed. You can update your payment method anytime in the "My Subscription" section of the client portal.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is "Fair Use" for unlimited services?',
    answer: 'For the Strategic Partner plan, "Unlimited" services (like contract drafting) are subject to a fair use policy. This ensures that the volume of requests remains reasonable and does not compromise the quality or turnaround time for other clients. Your advisor will discuss any concerns regarding excessive usage directly with you.',
